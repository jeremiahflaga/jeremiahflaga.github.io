Yesterday, the pediatrician assigned to our newborn baby said that our baby might undergo blood transfusion because of high bilirubin levels



https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC4935699/


> Unconjugated bilirubin is the predominant form and usually its serum level is less than 15 mg/dl (28). Based on the recent recommendations of the AAP, bilirubin levels up to 17–18 mg/dl may be accepted as normal in term of healthy newborns (15).


From <https://my.clevelandclinic.org/health/diseases/22263-jaundice-in-newborns> 

> Treatment for jaundice in newborns isn’t usually necessary. Mild levels of jaundice typically go away on their own as your baby’s liver continues to develop. This can take one to two weeks. Feeding your baby often (10 to 12 times a day) can encourage pooping (bowel movements). This helps your baby rid their body of the excess bilirubin.
