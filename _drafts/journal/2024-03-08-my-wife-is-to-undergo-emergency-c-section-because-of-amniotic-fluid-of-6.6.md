My pregnant wife is in the hospital because she is to undergo a C-section today, at 35 to 36 weeks pregnancy, because of amniotic fluid of 6.6cm. Her doctor said last Wednesday that that 6.6 is very low and that she needs to have an emergency C-section. 

I was surprised by that because she seems fine, and the baby inside her seems fine. Can't the baby wait for a few more weeks before she can go out?...

So I searched online to know if a 6.6cm amniotic fluid is really very low.

It says _"5 to 8 cm is considered borderline"_

Last week, my pregnant wife went through ultrasound

6.0 cm

She was admitted to the hospital and was given [dextrose]. The day after that... ultrasound, and the result was 10 cm. So we decided to go home because she can't sleep in the hospital.

A week later... ultrasound


6.6 cm

Her doctor decided that she go an emergency C-section
