As a mostly-selft-taught programmer, I oftentimes look for resources online that can help me improve my programming skills. 

[TeachYourselfCS.com](https://teachyourselfcs.com/) is one of those resources that I found. It recommends a book named [CSAPP](http://csapp.cs.cmu.edu/3e/perspective.html) 

> If the idea of self-studying 9 topics over multiple years feels overwhelming, we suggest you focus on just two books: Computer Systems: A Programmer's Perspective and Designing Data-Intensive Applications. In our experience, these two books provide incredibly high return on time invested, particularly for self-taught engineers and bootcamp grads working on networked applications. They may also serve as a "gateway drug" for the other topics...

What does "A Programmer's Perspective" mean?

Here's a quote from the CSAPP's website:

> Most books on systems—computer architecture, compilers, operating systems, and networking—are written as if the reader were going to design and implement such a system. We call this the “builder's persepective.” We believe that students should first learn about systems in terms of how they affect the behavior and performance of their programs — a “programmer's perspective.”

Nice!

So I looked for a free course which uses this book. And I found one on [LearnCS.me](https://learncs.me/): CMU's ["15-213 Introduction to Computer Systems"](https://learncs.me/cmu/15213)

I'm currently consuming the video lectures for this course, and is trying to do the labs. I'm going to put some hints on solving the labs in future posts.

## Info for those who want to take the course:

[Links to lecture videos and labs for Fall 2017](https://learncs.me/cmu/15213)

[Links to recitation videos for Fall 2015](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Sessions/List.aspx#folderID=%22b96d90ae-9871-4fae-91e2-b1627b43e25e%22) (no recitation videos available for Fall 2017): 

For Lecture 2, you might want to use the [video from the Fall 2015](https://scs.hosted.panopto.com/Panopto/Pages/Viewer.aspx?id=6ca8cdb4-6961-42d9-8fac-299e53759a17), because in the Fall 2017 video the blackboard notes of the prof are not clear. (But you can watch both videos)

In-class activities (with solutions) are available during the [Summer 2022 offering of the course](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/afs/cs/academic/class/15213-m22/www/schedule.html)

([Fall 2022](https://www.cs.cmu.edu/~213/resources.html) also has in-class activities)
