Hi, I'm Jeremiah Flaga. I am programmer and I love programming! 

I also like writing about stuffs that I learned recently, and about some thoughts that cross my mind. Most of the things I write will not be interesting to you... so, instead of pointing you directly to my [blog](/blog/), I'm going to link from my home page **a few blog posts which might interest you.**
