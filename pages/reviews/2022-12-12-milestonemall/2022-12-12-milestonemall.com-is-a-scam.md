I know someone who was scammed by milestonemall.com. I'm writing this to warn others about it.

First they will lure you into buying a PHP 500 worth of something, and will give you PHP 300 as commission.

Then they will lure you into buying something more pricey. But they will not give you the commision until you buy another much more pricey thing, worth about PHP 8000.

Then another much much more pricey item, worth about PHP 30,000.

They will even give you permits from DTI to convince you to that they are legit.

But when you run out of money and is not able to buy their pricey items, they will send you messages like this:

Beware...
