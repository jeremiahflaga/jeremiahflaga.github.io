A few days ago, while thinking about the decisions of the doctors involved my wife's emergency C-section and our baby's first days outside the womb, I remembered a statement made by a lecturer in [Stanford's CS106L Fall 2019](hhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLCgD3ws8aVdolCexlz8f3U-RROA0s5jWA) course, which I watched a week ago:

> "As in life, everything is a tradeoff."

That is from [Lecture 3 of the course, time 47:50](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PgqVnZxLFJY&list=PLCgD3ws8aVdolCexlz8f3U-RROA0s5jWA&index=10).

Thomas Sowell said something similar:

> "There are no solutions; only tradeoffs."


What were the doctors' decisions I was thinking about?

1. The emergency C-section done to my wife because of amniotic fluid of 6.6 cm 

   The doctor said that it was very low ("chronic oligohydramnios" was the assessment).

   But when I google for it, I find things like this:

   > A sum of less than 5 cm is considered oligohydramnios, 5 to 8 cm is considered borderline, 8 to 20 cm is considered normal, and greater than 20 to 25 cm is considered polyhydramnios.
   > 
   > The impact of oligohydramnios on pregnancy outcomes is **controversial**...

2. Giving antibiotics to my newborn child, because of procalcitonin value of 0.8 ng/ml at 12 hours after birth. The baby has no signs of infection. And no results of blood culture yet.

   But when I google for it, I find things like this:

   > In healthy neonates, plasma PCT values increase gradually after birth, reach peak values after 24 h of age (mean 1.5-2.5 ng/ml, range 0.1-20 ng/ml) and then decrease to normal values below 0.5 ng/ml by 48-72 h of age.

   They took the blood sample at 12 hours of age. They should have taken it after 3 days.

3. Do a blood transfusion on our baby because of high bilirubin levels.




I was only alarmed when the doctor said that the baby might need blood transfusion. My wife and I were worried if the doctor eventually decides to do blood transfusion because our baby looks healthy and consumes lots of milk, and poops, and pees, and is not crying that much. She only cries when wet of pee, or when unfomfortable with poop in her diapers, or when blood is extracted from her for tests, or when injected with antibiotics. Why would they do blood transfusion to her. Are they trying to make her sick so we will always bring her back to the hospital?

My wife and I decided to waive if the doctor decides to do blood transfusion. 

(Many of the people we know said that the yellowish color on her skin is just normal, and that it will go away on it's own. It gave us assurance that our decision was the right one.)

Then went to the nurse station and asked for the results of our baby's bilirubin test.

They placed our baby under lots of lights for more than a day (photo...). Then they extracted blood again to do another bilirubin test.

The test indicated that her bilirubin has gone higher than in the previous test. So I thought to myself that they might decide to do blood transfusion when the doctor visits the next day.

I was already skeptical when they gave our baby antibiotics even though she looks okay, had no fever, no signs of infection. Now that they are planning to do blood transfusion on her, I have to do some googling.

So I went to the nurse station and asked for the results of our baby's bilirubin test.



 of my wife's doctor (OB-GYN) to do an emergency C-section because of low amniotic fluid (6.6cm), I remembered what the lecturer said in Lecture 3 of that course.

That's what the lecturer in [Stanford's CS106L Fall 2019 semester](https://youtu.be/PgqVnZxLFJY?list=PLCgD3ws8aVdolCexlz8f3U-RROA0s5jWA&t=2850) said when comparing <vector> and <deque> of the C++ STL.
