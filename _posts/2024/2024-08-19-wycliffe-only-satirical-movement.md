> "I regard free speech as a prerequisite to a civilized society, because freedom of speech means that you can have combat with words. That's what it means. It doesn't mean that people can happily and gently exchange opinions. It means that we can engage in combat with words, in the battleground of ideas. And the reason that that's acceptable, and why it's acceptable that people's feelings get hurt during that combat, is that the combat of ideas is far preferable to actual combat."

## Introduction

The KJV Only movement is propagating lots of bad ideas, which is destroying the faith of the next generation of Christians.<sup>1</sup> 

But as people who advocate for free speech, it is against our values to stop them from propagating such bad ideas. But we can do something.

A wise man once said<sup>2</sup>:

> There is a simple rule about vital and free companies, communities, and societies:
>
> You never punish bad ideas.
>
> Instead, you counter bad ideas with better ideas.

What better idea is there to counter the King James Only movement than to start a new but better movement, called "The [Wycliffe Only](https://www.ibiblio.org/tnoble/) Movement".

Why is it better?

 - Wycliffe is centuries older than King James, and so is closer to the originals.
 - John Wycliffe was persecuted; so he was part of the true church<sup>3</sup>.
 - Wycliffe 1382-1390s uses more archaic words, phrases, and sentence construction; so it sounds more reverent than KJV 1611.
 - Wycliffe, unlike modern translations, does not mock the king.
 - Wycliffe, unlike modern translations, does not mock pastors.
 <!-- - Wycliffe 1382-1390s, unlike all the other modern translations, does not say that John Wycliffe and Jesus are the same person. -->
 - Wycliffe 1382-1390s was published before the printing press was invented. Everything was written by hand, so it truly was the "written word of God". All the modern translations are "printed word of God", a phrase which does not sound very authoritative.
 - ... and much more

<br />
<sup>1</sup> Even for those Christians who have remained in the faith after years of bombardment of KJV only ideas, they are being left defenseless and unprepared to the coming attacks to their faith; attacks which the thought leaders of KJV Only movement might have not yet encountered.
