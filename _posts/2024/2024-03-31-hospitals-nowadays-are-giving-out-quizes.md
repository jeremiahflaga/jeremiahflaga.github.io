&lt;satire&gt;

Hospitals nowadays are advocating for continuous learning. They are giving out quizzes: bring home quizzes. Open notes. We all know that open notes quizzes are hard.


## INSTRUCTIONS:

Answer the following questions, without looking at the hints at first.<br />
You can look at Hint #1 after 12 hours. <br />
Then at Hint #2 the next 12 hours, and so on.

Bring home quiz.<br />
Open notes.<br />
You can borrow notes from other humans.<br />
You can borrow notes from aliens too, as long as they live in the same universe as ours.


## QUESTIONS:

1. Given the data in the attached image, would you recommend a healthy one week old newborn to undergo blood transfusion?

   1.a) If you were the parent of the newborn, would you allow it?<br />
   1.b) If you were the doctor, would you allow it?<br />
   1.c) If you were one of the hospital's board of directors, but is not a doctor, would you allow it?

2. (optional) Define "healthy"

3. (optional) Define "harm"

_First answer to question 1.a :_ At this point, I did not look at the attached image. I only noticed the word "healthy" in the question. As a parent of the healthy baby, I (and my wife) can confidently say "no" to blood transfusion. 

Many people we know say that a yellowish skin color in newborns is normal.

**Hint #1:**
In our universe, designed by our ever wonderful Creator, is there a point in time and space where the statement "2 + 2 = 5" is true? Or is that statement always false?

_Second answer to question 1.a :_ At this point, I looked at the data, and I was nervous. I can't travel to all points in space and time to verify whether the statement "2 + 2 = 5" holds true in any of them!

Will our baby die? We would really be depressed if she dies.

I plan to agree with whatever the doctor recommends, even if my wife disagrees with me.

**Hint #2:**
There is an infinite number of infinities between zero and one.<br />
A greater number still between 2 and 21.<br />
Can the values 364.25 and 398.09 (which are lesser than infinities) fit between numbers 21 and 22?

_Third answer to question 1.a :_ Something fishy is going on here. 

They already gave antibiotics to my newborn child, because of procalcitonin value of 0.8 ng/ml at 12 hours after birth. The baby has no signs of infection. And no results of blood culture yet.

But when I look at the notes of other humans, I find things like this:

> In healthy neonates, plasma PCT values increase gradually after birth, reach peak values after 24 h of age (mean 1.5-2.5 ng/ml, range 0.1-20 ng/ml) and then decrease to normal values below 0.5 ng/ml by 48-72 h of age.

They took the blood sample at 12 hours of age. Should they have taken it at 48-72 hours of age??

And now they are saying that my daughter might need blood transfusion?

Are they trying to make it look like she is chronically ill on paper??
 <!-- so they can get more money from [PhilHealth](https://www.philhealth.gov.ph/)??  -->
<!-- (That is not a rhetorical question, by the way. That is a legitimate question.) -->

_Fourth answer to question 1.a :_ I would say "no" to blood transfusion, just like in my first answer.
