<div class="wycliffe-only-conversation" markdown="1">

A man has been telling Eve that if she does not serve God, bad things will happen to her.

"But what does serving God mean?", Eve asked the man.

"It means doing things according to my desires", the man said.

"Huh?"

"I mean doing things according to God's desires, which are the same as my desires", the man corrected himself.

"What does God desire.. What did God tell me?", Eve was trying to remember. "Ahh, it was to bear children â€” to be a mother. Everyone should be a mother!
<br />
"Everyone should be a mother!", she shouted in excitement.

"Uh, wait.. No!", the man shouted back. "That is not what I desire, therefore that is not what God desires."

"Why not. That's what God said in Genesis ch 3 v 16."

> Also God said to the woman, I shall multiply thy wretchednesses and thy conceivings; in sorrow thou shalt bear thy children; and thou shalt be under (the) power of thine husband, and he shall be lord of thee.
>
> (Wycliffe Bible 1382-1390s)


"Yes. But please note that recent versions of the Bible have actually weaken, or make blurry, the meaning of that verse, by replacing the phrase _'thou shalt be under (the) power of thine husband'_ with _'thy desire shall be to thy husband'_. These modern versions have been influenced by feminist ideas."

"That phrase has nothing to do with being a mother. Only the first section of that passage is relevant to our current topic, which is about mothers."

"But that phrase is also in the bible."

"It does not matter, because I'm talking about everyone becoming a mother right now, and not about anything else. Therefore we should only deal with passages which talk about being a mother."



Okay.. But how can I be a mother when I'm a man?

That's easy. Let's support the idea which says men can get pregnant?

I don't understand.

Let me explain. First, we support the idea that transwomen are real women. Transwomen are real men too. Women get pregnant. And because transwomen are women, therefore transwomen get pregnant. Transwomen are men too, and because transwomen get pregnant, therefore men get pregnant too. Therefore real men get pregnant. And therefore men can be mothers too. Easy.

Not easy.. And we know that men do not get pregnan..

Stop it right there. We do not start with that premise. We start with the premise which puts us much higher in the virtue ladder. We start with the premise "transwomen are real women" so that we win. If we start with the premise "men do not get pregnant" we lose.

We?

Yes. We.

Can we get away with that?

Sure.. People are so easily fooled these days because everyone believes everything on the internet.

Is the claim "people believe everything on the internet" even true?

Eve ignored him and started concocting a plan to establish a new religion which she can use to validate her premises and truth claims. 
<br />
"I will migrate to South Korea, the seoul of the earth, and change my name into Zahng Gil-jah. I will declare myself as mother god, and put it on the internet".

"Everyone should be a mother."
