I've encountered some bugs at work which motivated me to look for deeper knowledge regarding backend stuffs. That led me to Hussein Nasser's videos on YouTube and to his courses on Udemy.

I completed his course on [Fundamentals of Backend Engineering](https://www.udemy.com/course/fundamentals-of-backend-communications-and-protocols).

Happy debugging
