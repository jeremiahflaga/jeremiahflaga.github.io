I encountered those errors when integrating a Node.js app into a .NET Aspire application because of a stupid mistake: the path I used for the `workingDirectory` was wrong.

My NodeJS app was three levels of parent directories above my Aspire AppHost project, but I used `"../../nodejs-proj-folder"` for the `workingDirectory` parameter of `AddNpmApp` method.

``` csharp
var nodeJsApp = builder.AddNpmApp("nodeJsApp", "../../nodejs-proj-folder", "start:dev")
    ...
    ;
```

The correct path was supposed to be `"../../../nodejs-proj-folder"`.

I hope this saves someone out there from hours of debugging.

Note: I had `nvm` installed and was using it to control which version of NodeJS I use in my local machine. I encountered the first error above when using an older version of `nvm`. The 2nd error I encountered when I updated `nvm` to the latest version.
