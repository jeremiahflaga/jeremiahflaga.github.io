<div class="wycliffe-only-conversation" markdown="1">

A man has been telling everyone that if they do not do what God wants, bad things will happen to them.

"What do I want everyone to do?", God asked the man.

:open_mouth:

Ah, I remember. Genesis 1:1 says "In the beginning God made out of nothing the heavens and the earth."
<br />
That means, you, as my imagers, should be creating something. You should be creators.

Adam, thinking out loud, said, "Gardeners _create_ food. 
<br />
"Everyone should be gardeners."
<br />
Eve, thinking out loud, said, "Mothers _create_ babies. 
<br />
"Everyone should be a mother."
<br />
The snake, thinking out loud, said, "Uhmm... serpents _create_ tracks. 
<br />
"Everyone should become serpe... I mean, Everyone who go on their breast _create_ tracks.
<br />
"Everyone should go on their breast and eat the earth."

God called to them to correct their thinking.
<br />
"Adam, I advise you to read the short essay ['I Pencil'](https://fee.org/ebooks/i-pencil/) by Leonard E. Read, so you will realize that you cannot be an efficient gardener without the tools created by blacksmiths. If everyone were gardeners, who will create the gardeners tools?"
<br />
"Eve, I give you this biology textbook. Go read it."
<br />
"And you serpent, if everyone is going to eat the earth and you consume all of it, where would everyone live?"

"Oh my mistake", Adam replied. "Everyone should be gardeners and blacksmiths".
<br />
"My bad", Eve said. "Everyone should be a mother and a biology enthusiast (at the least). I disagree that only biologist can define what a woman is. I don't have time to take a four year biology course. Biology enthusiast can also define woman."
<br />
"Oooops", the serpent realized his mistake. "Everyone should become a physicist who believe in a multiverse. That will make it so that there is an infinite number of earths we can make tracks on and eat."
