<div class="wycliffe-only-conversation" markdown="1">

A man has been telling everyone that if they do not do what God wants, bad things will happen to them.

"What do I want everyone to do?", God asked the man.

:open_mouth:

Ah, I remember. Genesis 1:1 says "In the beginning God made out of nothing the heavens and the earth."
<br />
That means, you, as my imagers, should be creating something. You should be creators.

Adam, thinking out loud, said, "Gardeners _create_ food. 
<br />
"Everyone should be gardeners."
<br />
Eve, thinking out loud, said, "Mothers _create_ babies. 
<br />
"Everyone should be a mother."
<br />
The snake, thinking out loud, said, "Uhmm... serpents _create_ tracks. 
<br />
"Everyone should become serpe... I mean, Everyone who go on their breast _create_ tracks.
<br />
"Everyone should go on their breast and eat the earth."

God called to them to correct their thinking.
<br />
"Adam, I advise you to read the short essay ['I Pencil'](https://fee.org/ebooks/i-pencil/) by Leonard E. Read, so you will realize that you cannot be an efficient gardener without the tools created by blacksmiths. If everyone were gardeners, who will create the gardeners tools?"
<br />
"Eve, I give you this biology textbook. Go read it."
<br />
"And you serpent, if everyone is going to eat the earth and you consume all of it, where would everyone live?"

"Oh my mistake", Adam replied. "Everyone should be gardeners and blacksmiths".
<br />
"My bad", Eve said. "Everyone should be a mother and a biology enthusiast (at the least). I disagree that only biologist can define what a woman is. I don't have time to take a four year biology course. Biology enthusiast can also define woman."
<br />
"Oooops", the serpent realized his mistake. "Everyone should become a physicist who believe in a multiverse. That will make it so that there is an infinite number of earths we can make tracks on and eat. Take note that I said physicist, not just physics enthusiasts. Because how can a multiverse be true if only physics enthusiasts believe in it."

:man_facepalming:
<br />
"If everyone should become farmers and blacksmiths, who would create machines which helps farmers to scale?" 
<br />
"If everyone should become mothers and biology enthusiasts, who would create hospitals where mothers give birth to their babies. Who who make buildings where biology enthusiasts do their work?" 
<br />
"If everyone should go on thy ground and eat the earth and become physicists who believe in a multiverse, who would create rockets and spaceships on which we travel to other universes?" 

"The engineers!", Elon Musk replied. "Whew! At least I have one of the required professions. I'll buy more land, and become a farmer next."
<br />
"I am none of those", said Jose Rizal. "More work for me to do."
<br />
"Who then would write the [Wycliffe Bible](https://www.ibiblio.org/tnoble/)?", questioned John Wycliffe. "That's the book where you got your initial statements about what everyone should be doing."

"Very very good point!" :+1: :+1: :+1:
