Maciej "MJ" Jedrzejewski (Yen-dzhe-yev-ski) has written a free ebook: ["Understand Your Domain First: An Introduction to Event Storming and Domain-Driven Design"](https://newsletter.fractionalarchitect.io/p/52-free-ebook-understand-your-domain).

> I designed this book to be as close to a workshop experience as possible, and I did my best to make it so.

That's what he said in the Preface of the book.

So to get my brain engaged while reading, I tried to [imitate](/2024/12/14/diagramming-practice-for-system-design) the Event Storming diagrams in the book using [Miro](https://miro.com/), which is the diagramming tool recommended in the book.

Here are the diagrams I produced:

2. Gym App - Event Storming - Process Level - Publishing an offer

3. Gym App - Event Storming - Process Level - Signing a contract

"MJ" has also written a book titled ["Master Software Architecture"](https://mastersoftwarearchitecturebook.com/).

In the Preface of that book, he said something that many software engineers can relate to:

> In the last eight years, I have made almost every mistake related to software
architecture that you can think of. To name a few, I:
> 
> • applied Onion, Clean or Hexagonal architecture everywhere I could;
> 
> • assumed that people not doing test-driven development, continuous deployments
or trunk-based development are crazy;
> 
> • used microservices in almost every application;
> 
> • ran all my tiny applications in Kubernetes;
> 
> • used cache everywhere.
> 
> Do you see a pattern here? I mindlessly followed each concept without deeper
thinking.
> 
> Whatever I heard, I applied. I easily justified it to myself because these were always described as silver bullet solutions, and of course, I wanted to follow best practices.
> 
> This contradicts pragmatism.

The rest of the guides you though how to produce software effectively.

I have not yet finished the book. I have read up to chapter 6 only. I decided to skip chapter 7 during the first reading because it talks about [evolutionary architecture and its corresponding repository on GitHub](https://github.com/evolutionary-architecture/), and I have already done an initial investigation of that repository before the book was published. 

I think this is one of the best books I have read on software development. It's unique because it talks about the whole cycle in software development --- from planning to maintenance. I'm hoping to re-read it from the start to finish before the year ends.
